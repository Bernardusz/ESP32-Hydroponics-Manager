# ğŸŒ± ESP32-Hydroponics-Manager

> An IoT-based hydroponics monitoring system using ESP32

## ğŸ“Š Features (MVP)
- Real-time pH sensor reading
- TDS (PPM) sensor monitoring
- Water level detection
- Data sent via serial to Java Android app
- SD Card data logging (soon)

## ğŸ–¨ Hardware List 
- ESP32 CP2102 38 Pin
- pH Meter Sensor (PH-4502C with Probe)
- TDS Meter Sensor
- DHT22
- USB Power Adapter + USB C Cable
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard / PCB

## ğŸ–¥ Software & Dependencies
- ğŸ’» Software :
  - PlatformIO (Arduino Framework)
  - Java Android Studio for companion app
  
- ğŸ“š Library / Dependencies:
  - | Sensor        | Library       |
    | ------------- | ------------- |
    | DHT22  | Adafruit DHT sensor library|
    | TDS Meter  | Analog reading (No library)  |
    | Water Level Sensor | Analog reading (No Library)|
